Block imaging - the acquisition of each frame starts immediately after the previous frame. Then the acquisition is stopped to wait till the PC finishes reading the FIFO
con: stopping and re-starting the z-stage could take several ms and could be non-deterministic

Interleaved imaging - After acquiring a frame, the code waits for number of RS swings so that the PC finish reading the FIFO. The z-stage runs continuously
